### Create Tableau Hyper File

In this task, my main goal was to get fetch data from client's AWS redshift database using their given API. Once data is retrieved, then do some cleaning mean that consistent datatypes, fill missing values etc.
Then create a hyper file with a dynamic data types method. Once hyper file is ready, then upload it to the user's Tableau server. 

This task was done and documented in one python file because it was a requirement from client.
